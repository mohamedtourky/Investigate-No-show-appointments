# Investigate-No-show-appointments
This dataset collects information from 110k medical appointments in Brazil we will try here to ask some questions to find out a relationship or a correlation between the data we have been provided and it's affection on patient show or no show for there appointment



Conclusions
we can see that SMS recivied have a huge infelunce in attending of patient so changing in sms recived can make a huge impact in patient attendice the correlation between chronic diseases like hypertension , daibates and age is not strog correlation , almost both of the show and noshow pie are similar so the gender does not affect on attending , seems like only two places strongly affected by neighbourhood ( Maria Ortiz & Jabour ) but generaly it is weak corrlation , we have 3583 patient are suffer from the both chronic diseases but there is no huge affect in attending , so i think that they need to establish an technical support department to make sure that many people recieved the massage or get a new contract with another telecom firm

The limitation
could not find a correlation between some given data like ("AppointmentID", "ScheduledDay", "AppointmentDay") and show or noshow of the patient . i think it is will be a good idea if we add a survey column with a scale 1 to 5 telling us how much patiant are satisfied of the service . it also will give us a good indicater if they will show or not and will give us also an indicator of which sectors that need some inerest in the future .
